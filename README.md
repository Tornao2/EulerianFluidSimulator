# Grid-Based Fluid Simulator

Description:

This project is supposed to be a simplified fluid simulation using grid model to represent the state of the scene.

Currently its resolution is 1500x900 with menu taking up 300px of width, cellsize is 60 pixels and target framerate is 60fps with each of these being able to be adjusted in the file with the main function by changing the constants.

It allows for modification of colors that fluid can take(up to 8 and the obstruction objects), size of the brush, whether grid should be reset, whether velocities should be displayed and which mode should the brush take at runtime by using the inbuilt menu with proper safeguards against incorrect numbers with the use of mouse and keyboard. The color of the menu, selected fields and font size can also be changed in the menu.h by changing the constants.
